# Jupiter
**Jupiter** is an open source and modular **front-end framework** for developing fast and powerful **cross-platform** interfaces on Qt Quick and QML.

**Note :** This framework is not yet complete and conceptually under development. So big changes might happen. If you intend to use this in your project, you should use a stable version because master change often.
